# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Course

In this repo, it contains the projects I worked on for the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Course on Udacity.  Each course is separated into directories.  For each directory, a clone from the relevant repo is made, followed by the necessary edits required to constitute a complete submission for that project.  You may consult each directory for the instructions for that particular project for more details.

## Project #1 - Simple Lane Finding Algorithm

This directory contains a method using simple computer vision algorithms to help localise where lanes are with respect to the ego vehicle.  Given sample images from the front camera of a car on a highway, we determine the left and right lanes for the car.  Please navigate to the `CarND-LaneLines-P1` directory for more details.  The report can be found in this directory under `reflection_report.md`.

## Project #2 - Advanced Lane Finding Algorithm

This directory contains a method using more advanced computer vision algorithms to help localise where lanes are with respect to the ego vehicle.  The objective and criteria for performance evaluation are the same as Project #1.  Please navigate to the `CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-P2` directory for more details.  The report can be found in this directory under `reflection_report.md`.

## Project #3 - Traffic Sign Classification Algorithm

This directory contains a method using deep learning to classify traffic sign images.  We specifically explore the dataset used for training this system and provide an architecture that performs the classification well on the training, validation and test dataset.  Please navigate to the `CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classification-Project-P3` directory for more details.  The report can be found in this directory under `final_report.md`.
